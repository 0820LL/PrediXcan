Frequently Asked Questions

- What does TW mean in the model names?
  - We use TW to refer to the models trained with the original tissue expression. This makes sense in relation to the tissue specific expression models (TS*) we have derived using Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition [See Details Here](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/15/043653.1)

- Are performance measures of prediction available
  - Yes, they can be found in the `extra` table in each sqlite db
  
- How do I query the prediction model db?
  - Find example queries in [link](https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan/blob/master/Software/query-db.Rmd)
